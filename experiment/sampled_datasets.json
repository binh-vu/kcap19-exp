In 2015 data were collected at 18 stratified randomly selected sites. These data include:\n\n1) an assessment of coral colony density and size-class distribution for the selected monitoring sites;\n\n2) an assessment of coral recruitment at the monitoring sites; and\n\n3) an evaluation of coral colony condition, including mortality, disease, and bleaching.\n\nThese data can be accessed online via the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Ocean Archive.

Optional parameters include total solar radiation.Each site maintains at least one meteorological station. Stations are placed at locations typical of local conditions or in areas where a specific need for weather data has been identified. Data are reported at 15 minute intervals. Prior to 2007, hourly and daily average data were also reported. The National Estuarine Research Reserves is a network of 28 reserves protected for long-term research, ecosystem monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship. Established by the Coastal Zone Management Act, the reserve system is a partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states. NOAA provides funding, national guidance, and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on daily basis by a lead state agency or university with input from local partners. These data are collected as part of the NERRS System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), which includes (1) abiotic indicators of water quality and weather, (2) biological monitoring, and (3) watershed, habitat, and land use mapping. Data were collected under individual Reserve NOAA grant\/cooperative agreements and managed by the CDMO under NOAA grant\/cooperative agreement #NA16NOS4200125 (2016) and prior grants.

These observations have been merged to create the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) Release 3.0 (Freeman et al. 2017) and are now available in this collection in the netCDF 4.0 format. The spatial coverage is global and sampling density varies depending on date and geographic position relative to shipping routes and ocean observing systems. The temporal coverage is from 1662 to present and organized by one file per month.\n\nThis is the netCDF version of the ICOADS Release 3.0 (R3.0), which is converted from the original IMMA1 format (Smith et al 2017). Useful metadata have been added in the global and variable attributes of each file to make the netCDF self-contained. R3.0 includes changes designed to enable more effective exchange of information describing data quality between ICOADS, reanalysis centers, data set developers, scientists and the public. These user-driven innovations include the assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each marine report, to enable tracing of observations, linking with reports and improved data sharing. Many new input data and metadata sources have been assembled, and updates and improvements to existing data sources, or removal of erroneous data, made.\n\nReferences:\nFreeman, E., Woodruff, S.

Energy flows through nature into social systems as life support. Human societies depended on renewable, solar powered energy for fuel, shelter, tools, and other items for most of our history. Today, when we flip on a light switch, turn an ignition or a water faucet, or eat a hamburger, we engage complex energy extraction systems that largely rely on non-renewable energy to power our lives. About 90% of Vermont's total energy consumption is currently generated from non-renewable energy sources.

Eastern hemlock is shade tolerant, long-lived, and slow-growing. It is usually restricted to steep terrain on north facing slopes adjacent to streams, but is also frequently planted in urban and suburban areas, where it grows well outside its natural habitat. \nEastern Hemlock has become increasingly uncommon due to impacts from exotic insects: Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae) and Elongate Hemlock Scale (Fiorinia externa).

The instruments measure the brightness temperature (Tb) for each channel and corresponds to an average temperature of the atmosphere averaged over that channel's weighting function. Global average and global anomaly maps on a 2.5 x 2.5 degree resolution are produced from each month's data from both the MSU and the AMSU for over a 31 year period (1978-2011) for each channel (layer); the Temperature Lower Troposphere (TLT); the Temperature Middle Troposphere (TMT); the Temperature Troposphere\/Stratosphere (TTS) ; the Temperature Lower Stratosphere (TLS). UAT 4 Layer MW data is important to continue into the future to ensure the existence of a high-quality record of atmospheric temperatures for climate change detection and climate model verification activities.

The Area of Interest (AOI) is 632,000 acres and is larger than the actual\n                burn acreage of approximately 150,000 acres that lies within the AOI. Aerial imagery\n                was collected with a frame - based Z\/I Digital Mapping Camera at an average of\n                elevation of 4,500 feet above ground; generating an average ground sample distance\n                (gsd) of 0.45 feet. This aerial imagery will be used to create natural color and\n                false color infrared digital orthophotos of the AOI at a re-sampled gsd of .3\n                meters. The imagery will support the Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response\n                (BAER) program that addresses landscape damage due to the fire, with the goal of\n                protecting life, property, water quality, and deteriorated ecosystems from further\n                damage now that the fire is out. While many wildfires cause little damage to the\n                land and pose few threats to fish, wildlife and people downstream, the fires of 2011\n                has in this case created situations that require special efforts to prevent further\n                problems after the fire. Loss of vegetation exposes soil to erosion; runoff may\n                increase and cause flooding, sediments may move downstream and damage houses or fill\n                reservoirs, and put endangered species and community water supplies at risk. The\n                imagery will support the Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)\n                program that addresses these situations with the goal of protecting life, property,\n                water quality, and deteriorated ecosystems from further damage after the fire is\n                out. In addition, other federal, tribal, state, and local governments will be\n                participating in similar program along with Universities in the region. ",

NorWeST summer stream temperature scenarios were developed for all rivers and streams in the western U.S. from the greater than 20,000 stream sites in the NorWeST database where mean August stream temperatures were recorded. The resulting dataset includes stream lines (NorWeST_PredictedStreams) and associated mid-points NorWest_TemperaturePoints) representing 1 kilometer intervals along the stream network. Stream lines were derived from the 1:100,000 scale NHDPlus dataset (USEPA and USGS 2010; McKay et al. 2012). Shapefile extents correspond to NorWeST processing units, which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes (HUCs) or in some instances closely correspond to state borders. The line and point shapefiles contain identical modeled stream temperature results. The two feature classes are meant to complement one another for use in different applications. In addition, spatial and temporal covariates used to generate the modeled temperatures are included in the attribute tables at https:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/rm\/boise\/AWAE\/projects\/NorWeST\/ModeledStreamTemperatureScenarioMaps.shtml. The NorWeST NHDPlusV1 processing units include: Salmon, Clearwater, Spokoot, Missouri Headwaters, Snake-Bear, MidSnake, MidColumbia, Oregon Coast, South-Central Oregon, Upper Columbia-Yakima, Washington Coast, Upper Yellowstone-Bighorn, Upper Missouri-Marias, and Upper Green-North Platte.

The Department of the Environment collects this data from various sources and calculates the emissions per current greenhouse gas protocols. This data supports San Francisco's climate change planning and mitigation strategies.\n\nNote: Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated based on the ICLEI 2012 U.S. Community Protocol Version 1.0. San Francisco inventories are completed in accordance with the ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol (USCP) for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The methodology and sectors tracked were third party verified in inventory year 2012. The subsequent inventories are completed according to the guidance of the verifiers. The third-party verification memo for 2010 is available at http:\/\/sfenvironment.org\/download\/2010-community-greenhouse-gas-inventory-3rd-party-verification-memo-march-2013 and for 2012 at http:\/\/sfenvironment.org\/download\/2012-community-greenhouse-gas-inventory-3rd-party-verification-memo-january-2015. In 2015, the City began reporting its emissions to C40 to improve its GHG emissions inventory by using a newer protocol to estimate emissions referred to as the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC). GPC is a framework unifying emissions inventories globally while incorporating new categories to track. San Francisco has been tracking its emissions since 1990; hence, it continues to use the ICLEI USCP. Today, San Francisco continues to disclose emissions under the GPC framework for reporting purposes to and compliance with the Global Covenant of Mayors (GCOM).",

        "notes":"The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites collect visible and infrared cloud imagery as well as monitoring the atmospheric, oceanographic, hydrologic, cryospheric and near-Earth space environments. The DMSP program maintains a constellation of sun-synchronous, near-polar orbiting satellites. The orbital period is 101 minutes and inclination is 99 degrees. The atmospheric and oceanographic sensors record radiances at visible, infrared and microwave wavelengths. The solar geophysical sensors measure ionospheric plasma fluxes, densities, temperatures and velocities. DMSP visible and infrared imagery of clouds covers a 3,000 km swath, thus each satellite provides global coverage of both day night time conditions each day. The field view of the microwave imagers and sounders is only 1,500 km thus approximately 3 days data are required for one instrument to provide global coverage at equatorial latitudes. The solar geophysical instruments make in-situ measurements of ionospheric parameters, some of which vary very rapidly. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) receive the complete DMSP data stream from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska. Data are currently transmitted in near realtime from AFWA directly to the archive via a designated T1 line. Archive processing prepares orbital data sets of calibrated, quality assessed data organized as a time-series, restores data lost during transmission,and accurately computes satellite positions. NCEI maintains an archive of all data recorded on DMSP satellites as relayed to The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) by the Air Force Weather Agency. Data from March 1992 to March 1994, are considered to be experimental. After March 1994, the system was fully operational. NCEI archives contain data that are post process reconstructed, positioned and geolocated using the same software.",

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).<\/p>\n<p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.<\/p>\n<p>Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as \u201cUnreliable\u201d in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.<\/p>\n<p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.<\/p>\n<p>Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999\u20132015. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).<\/p>\n",

Site information includes the location name, GPS coordinates, water depth, reef zone that describes the site (hardbottom, patch reef, mid-channel reef, deep reef, or bank reef), as well as basic environmental conditions such as wind speed and air temperature, cloud cover, and water temperature at both the surface and at depth. Basic bleaching observations include the severity of bleaching observed overall at the site (no bleaching, paling, bleached only on the upper surface, completely bleached), the growth forms of corals affected (brain, branching, fleshy, flower\/cup, leaf\/plate\/sheet, or mound\/boulder), the percent of overall coral cover at the site affected, and the depth range where bleaching is observed. Finally, observers are asked to note bleaching in other species of interest, including fire coral, zooanthids, and gorgonians, as well as any other observations of coral disease or mortality that may be occurring at the site. After exiting the water, observers simply enter these observations on the report form provided. Observers are asked to report as regularly as possible, and are made to understand that observations of no bleaching present are equally as important.",

        "notes":" \n        This report is an impact evaluation of two components of the Rural Business Development Program (RBD) in Nicaragua, specifically the components benefitting rice and plantain farmers on Nicaragua\u2019s Pacific coast. The RBD program helped finance irrigation equipment, inputs, and extension services for plantain producers, as well as extension, inputs, and drying patios for rice producers in 2009 and 2010; the price of rice is a function of its moisture content, and by increasing access to drying patios the RBD program sought to increase the value of sales by producers. Using a unique data set collected for the evaluation, average impacts of the RBD program on participating plantain farmers were estimated using difference-in-differences, while average impacts of the rice component on beneficiaries were estimated using fixed effects regressions. Estimated program impacts were combined with administrative cost data to calculate an internal rate of return for the plantain program and for one aspect of the rice program (construction of drying patios).\n\nKey results of the evaluation are: \n-Estimated impacts suggest that the RBD rice program raised yields and revenues by 11% in the 2009 - 2010 growing season and 18% in 2010 - 2011 on average relative to the yields and revenues beneficiaries would have obtained without the program. \n-The estimated ERR of the drying patio component of the RBD rice program ranges from 7% under the assumption of a five year lifespan for drying patios to 27% when assuming a 20 year lifespan. \n-No ERR was estimated for the input\/extension component of the rice program; part of the value of the extension\/input bundles received by beneficiaries was to be paid back by each beneficiary farmer to his or her cooperative, and the sum total of payments was to serve as seed money for credit funds managed by cooperatives in future years. The  reliance of future benefits of this program component on farmer repayment performance makes its long-term value uncertain; therefore I chose to focus my ERR calculation on the drying patios. \n-While average impacts and the drying patio ERR are both positive, RBD rice program impacts are estimated imprecisely, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that average impacts of the program on yields and revenues were zero. \n-Estimated impacts of the RBD plantain program were large and significant for revenues and yields of first quality plantains (harvested plantains come in three different quality grades). \n-The average impact of the RBD program on sales suggests that the program raised the value of plantain sales by 72% relative to what beneficiaries would have obtained without the RBD program. \n-I use the estimated impact on revenues as well as administrative data on production costs and program costs to estimate the ERR of the plantain program. \n-The plantain ERR ranges from -23% when assuming a lifespan of 5 years for irrigation equipment and 13% when assuming a lifespan of 20 years. \n-The apparent discrepancy between large impacts on sales and the modest ERR is a reflection of the high cost per beneficiary of the program, which was around $15,062 per farmer for the cohort studied here (around $3.6 million divided by 239 beneficiaries).\n      ",

In Vermont, RSA area delineations rely primarily on utilization data. The methods used are similar to those used by David Goodman to define primary care service areas based on Medicare data, but include additional sources of utilization data. Using these methods, towns were assigned based on where residents are going for their primary care. <\/p><p><\/p><p>The process used to delineate Vermont RSAs was iterative. It began by examining utilization patterns based on: (1) the primary care service areas that Goodman had defined for Vermont from Medicare data; (2) Vermont Medicaid assignments of clients to primary care providers; and, (3) responses to the \u201ctown of residence\u201d\/\u201dtown of primary care\u201d questions in the Vermont Behavioral Risk Factor survey. Taking into account the limitations of each of these sources of data, VDH statisticians defined preliminary town centers and were able to assign approximately two\/thirds of the towns to a town center. For towns with no clear utilization patterns, they examined mileage from these preliminary centers, and mileage from towns that had primary care physicians. Contiguity of areas was also examined. A few centers were added and others were deleted. After all towns were assigned to a center and mapped, outliers were identified and reviewed by referring to both mileage maps and utilization patterns. Drive time information was not available. In some cases where the mileage map seemed to indicate one center, but the utilization patterns were strongly supportive of another center, utilization was used as a proxy for drive time.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Preliminary RSAs were presented to the Vermont Primary Care Collaborative, the Vermont Coalition of Clinics for the Uninsured and other community members for their feedback. Department of Health District Directors from the Division of Community Public Health were also consulted. These groups suggested modifications to the areas based on their experience working in the areas in question. As a result of this review a few centers were added, deleted and combined, and several towns were reassigned. The Vermont Primary Care Collaborative reviewed the final version of RSAs. <\/p><p><\/p><p>The result of this process is 38 Rational Service Areas.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Given the limitations of the information available for this purpose, the delineation approach was deemed reasonable and has resulted in a set of RSAs that have been widely reviewed and accepted. Because of the iterative process, it is recognized that this is not a &quot;pure&quot; methodology in the sense that someone else attempting to replicate this process would probably not produce exactly the same results. <\/p><p><\/p><p>RSAs have been reviewed periodically to keep up with changes in demographics and provider practice locations. One revision occurred in 2011. This 2011 revision took towns that had originally been assigned as using out-of-state providers and reassigned them to Vermont RSAs. <\/p><p><\/p><p>Technical Details:<\/p><p><\/p><p>Vermont RSAs were defined using 3 sources of primary care utilization data and mileage maps. Each of the data sources had limitations, and these limitations had to be considered as towns were assigned to a RSA. A description of each of these data sources is provided. <\/p><p><ol><li><p>Medicare utilization data was obtained from the Primary Care Service Areas developed by David Goodman using 1996 and 1997 Medicare Part B and Outpatient files. Thirty-eight primary care service areas were defined for Vermont. The major limitation of these assignments was that they were based on zip codes rather than town boundaries. Many small towns do not have their own zip code, or the town may be divided into multiple zip codes shared with multiple other towns. As the utilization data was reviewed consideration was given to whether the zip code in question represented the town, or whether utilization from that town may have been masked by a larger town's utilization patterns. A second consideration was that the Medicare data used 1996 &amp; 1997 utilization. In areas where there were new practices established after 1997, the Medicare data would not be able to reflect their utilization.<\/p><p><\/p><\/li><li><p>Medicaid claims data only included children age 17 and under. The file contained Medicaid clients in 2000 with the town of residence of the client and the town of the primary care provider. The limitation in this file was that although the Medicaid database included a field for the geographic location of the provider separate from the mailing address, after examining the file it was determined that in many cases the mailing address was also being entered into the geographic location. In areas where practices were owned by a larger organization, the utilization patterns could not be determined. For example, in the St. Johnsbury RSA there were practices owned by an out-of-state medical center. Although it is known that there are medicaid providers in some of the towns in that area, all of the utilization was coded to out of state. Therefore the Medicaid data had to be disregarded in this area. The St. Johnsbury RSA was subsequently defined around three town centers (St. Johnsbury, Lyndon, and Danville) because more precise utilization patterns could not be distinguished.<\/p><p><\/p><\/li><li><p>The BRFSS data was obtained from the 1998-2000 surveys. Respondents were asked for the town of their primary care provider. The town of residence of the respondent is also collected. These responses represented all Vermonters age 18-64 years old, regardless of type of insurance. The limitation of this data was small number of respondents in the smaller towns. <\/p><p><\/p><\/li><li><p>Mileage information was obtained from the Vermont Medicaid program. This mileage information was derived using GIS mapping software to assess all statewide roads. However, drive-time data could not be determined at that time because there was no distinction between primary and secondary roads. The Medicaid program applied GIS mapping software to assign clients to primary care providers using 15 miles as a proxy for 30-minute drive time. This standard was also used in 2001 when the original RSAs were developed.<\/p><\/li><\/ol><\/p><p><\/p><p>The VDH Public Health Statistics program periodically updates RSA GIS data.

Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2012 Integrated Report.  Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered \"impaired\".\n\nNew impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the \"303(d) Impaired Waters Report\", commonly referred to as the \"impaired waters list.\" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, \"Total Maximum Daily Load,\" or \"TMDL\"). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).",

The Chicago Park District partners with the University of Illinois at Chicago Department of Public Health Laboratory to analyze water samples using a new DNA testing method called Rapid Testing Method (qPCR analysis) which tests for Enterococci in order to monitor swimming safety. \n \nThe rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a 4-5 hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 1000* CCE. When DNA bacteria levels exceed 1000 CCE, a yellow swim advisory flag is implemented. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria (http:\/\/water.epa.gov\/scitech\/swguidance\/standards\/criteria\/health\/recreation).\n \nHistorically, the Chicago Park District used the culture based analysis method and statistical prediction models to monitor beach water quality. \nThe culture based method tests for Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. The Chicago Park District would use results of the culture based method to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels, which is 235* CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented. This standard is still used at most beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.\n \nThe statistical prediction model forecasted real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https:\/\/data.cityofchicago.org\/d\/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https:\/\/data.cityofchicago.org\/d\/k7hf-8y75). The Chicago Park District would use results of the predictive model to notify the public when bacteria levels would exceed 235 CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow swim advisory flag was implemented.\n \n* The unit of measurement for Escherichia coli is Colony Forming Units (CFU) per 100 milliliters of water. (Culture Based Method \/ Statistical Prediction Model)\n*The unit of measuring DNA is Enterococci Calibrator Cell Equivalents (CCE) per 100 milliliters of water. (Rapid Testing Analysis)",

Royce and published as the second part of the two-part Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1896-1897 have been scanned, georeferenced in JPEG2000 format, and digitized to create this feature class of cession maps. The mapped cessions and reservations included in the 67 maps correspond to entries in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions, \u201cindicating the number and location of each cession by or reservation for the Indian tribes from the organization of the Federal Government to and including 1894, together with descriptions of the tracts so ceded or reserved, the date of the treaty, law or executive order governing the same, the name of the tribe or tribes affected thereby, and historical data and references bearing thereon,\u201d as set forth in the subtitle of the Schedule. Go to this URL for full metadata: http:\/\/data.fs.usda.gov\/geodata\/edw\/edw_resources\/meta\/S_USA.TRIBALCEDEDLANDS.xml Each Royce map was georeferenced against one or more of the following USGS 1:2,000,000 National Atlas Feature Classes contained in \\NatlAtlas_USGS.gdb: cities_2mm, hydro_ln_2mm, hydro_pl_2mm, plss_2mm, states_2mm. Cessions were digitized as a file geodatabase (GDB) polygon feature class, projected as NAD83 USA_Contiguous_Lambert_Conformal_Conic, which is the same projection used to georeference the maps. The feature class was later reprojected to WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere) to optimize it for the Tribal Connections Map Viewer. Polygon boundaries were digitized as to not deviate from the drawn polygon edge to the extent that space could be seen between the digitized polygon and the mapped polygon at a viewable scale. Topology was maintained between coincident edges of adjacent polygons. The cession map number assigned by Royce was entered into the feature class as a field attribute. The Map Cession ID serves as the link referencing relationship classes and joining additional attribute information to 752 polygon features, to include the following: 1. Data transcribed from Royce\u2019s Schedule of Indian Land Cessions: a. Date(s), in the case of treaties, the date the treaty was signed, not the date of the proclamation; b. Tribe(s), the tribal name(s) used in the treaty and\/or the Schedule; and c. Map Name(s), the name of the map(s) on which a cession number appears; 2. URLs for the corresponding entry in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions (Internet Archive) for each unique combination of a Date and reference to a Map Cession ID (historical references in the Schedule are included); 3. URLs for the corresponding treaty text, including the treaties catalogued by Charles J. Kappler in Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties (HathiTrust Digital Library), executive order or other federal statute (Library of Congress and University of Georgia) identified in each entry with a reference to a Map Cession ID or IDs; 4. URLs for the image of the Royce map(s) (Library of Congress) on which a given cession number appears; 5. The name(s) of the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text, as well as the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes; and 6. The present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. During the 2017-2018 revision of the attribute data, it was noted that 7 of the Cession Map IDs are missing spatial representation in the Feature Class. The missing data is associated with the following Cession Map IDs: 47 (Illinois 1), 65 (Tennessee and Bordering States), 128 (Georgia), 129 (Georgia), 130 (Georgia), 543 (Indian Territory 3), and 690 (Iowa 2), which will be updated in the future. This dataset revises and expands the dataset published in 2015 by the U.S. Forest Service and made available through the Tribal Connections viewer, the Forest Service Geodata Clearinghouse, and Data.gov. The 2018 dataset is a result of collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations (OTR); the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National NAGPRA Program; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of International and Tribal Affairs, American Indian Environmental Office; and Dr. Claudio Saunt of the University of Georgia. The Forest Service and Dr. Saunt independently digitized and georeferenced the Royce cession maps and developed online map viewers to display Native American land cessions and reservations. Dr. Saunt subsequently undertook additional research to link Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statutes and executive orders to cession and reservation polygons, which he agreed to share with the U.S. Forest Service. OTR revised the data, linking the Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statues and executive orders to all 1,172 entries in the attribute table. The 2018 dataset has incorporated data made available by the National NAGPRA Program, specifically the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text and the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes, as well as the present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. This data replaces in its entirety the National NAGPRA data included in the dataset published in 2015. The 2015 dataset incorporated data presented in state tables compiled from the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions by the National NAGPRA Program. In recent years the National NAGPRA Program has been working to ensure the accuracy of this data, including the reevaluation of the present-day Indian tribes and the provision of references for their determinations. Changes made by the OTR have not been reviewed or approved by the National NAGPRA Program. The Forest Service will continue to collaborate with other federal agencies and work to improve the accuracy of the data included in this dataset. Errors identified since the dataset was published in 2015 have been corrected, and we request that you notify us of any additional errors we may have missed or that have been introduced. Please contact Rebecca Hill, Policy Analyst, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations, at rebeccahill@fs.fed.us with any questions or concerns with regard to the data included in this dataset.\u00a0",

        "notes":"HOSPITALS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains hospital locations, as developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named \"2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp.\" The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC): \"Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation\u00c2\u0092s critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom. \"HSIP Gold: Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as \u00c2\u0093disclosure\u00c2\u0094 in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data. \"HSIP Freedom: NGA\u00c2\u0092s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach \u00c2\u0096 HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit. \"The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the \"License Free\u00c2\u0094 HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.\" The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named \"2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp\": \"Hospitals in Indiana \"The term \"hospital\" means an institution which: \"(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients \" (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or \" (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; \"(5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times; ... \"(7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, \" (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or \" (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing; \"(Excerpt from Title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1395x(e)], ) \"Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.). \"TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical\/surgical hospitals in Indiana. Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in Indiana are represented in this dataset. \"Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA) are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals. \"Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a separate dataset. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. \"Records with \"-DOD\" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. \"Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. \"All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. \"The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

        "notes":"The stationary point count (SPC) method is used to conduct reef fish surveys in the Hawaiian and Mariana Archipelagos, American Samoa, and the Pacific Remote Island Areas as part of the NOAA National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP). The SPC method catalogs the diversity (species richness), abundance (numeric density) and biomass (fish mass per unit area) of diurnally active reef fish assemblages in shallow-water (less than 30 m) hard-bottom habitats. Visual estimates of benthic cover and topographic complexity are also recorded, with benthic organisms grouped into broad functional categories (e.g., 'Hard Coral', 'Macroalgae'). A stratified random sampling (StRS) design is employed to survey the coral reef ecosystems throughout the U.S.-Pacific regions. For all regions, the survey domain encompasses the majority of the mapped area of reef and hard bottom habitats and the stratification includes island, reef zone, and depth, with the exception of the Main Hawaiian Islands that includes habitat structure type as well. Sampling effort is allocated based on strata area.\n\nReef fish and benthic estimate data provided in this data set were collected during SPC surveys as part of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), Ecosystem Sciences Division (formerly the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division) led NCRMP missions around the Main Hawaiian Islands in 2013 and 2016, and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 2016. Data collected as part of Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument funded research cruises in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 2014, 2015, and 2017 are also included as these data are funded separately from but are complementary to the NCRMP-funded data. \n\nAdditionally, data collected as part of a PIFSC-funded Reef Fish Survey cruise in the Main Hawaiian Islands in 2015 are included as these data are funded separately from but are complementary to the NCRMP-funded data. During the 2015 and cruise, some sites were surveyed using both open-circuit SCUBA (OC) and closed-circuit rebreather (CCR), as part of an ongoing assessment of sources of bias in survey count relating to divers' presence. The CCR data is archived separately.",

Unlike liquid level gauges that rely on discrete measurements to give broad approximations of liquid levels, Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s novel method provides measurements at &amp;frac14;-inch intervals within a tank. The system uses fiber optic Bragg sensors located along a single fiber optic cable. These sensors actively discern between the liquid and gas states along a continuous fiber to pinpoint the liquid level. This significant leap forward in precision and accuracy in liquid level sensing offers significant benefits to many industries. Designed to monitor a rocket&amp;rsquo;s cryogenic fuel levels, the technology can be used in many medical and industrial applications.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date&lt;\/strong&gt;: The technology has been demonstrated in multiple environments using conventional validation techniques. First, water level measurements have been conducted to demonstrate operation within a benign environment. Second, liquid level measurements were conducted in liquid nitrogen using a 6-foot dewer. Measurements also were conducted within a liquid hydrogen environment using a 4-foot dewer. The technology performed well in all three cases, demonstrating the ability to measure liquid to &amp;frac14; inch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;\/strong&gt;: The team continues to push the fields of application with future tests to determine boundary layers between different fluids such as oil and water. Also there are planned opportunities to demonstrate the technology in a NASA-operated cryogenic test bed, simulating a cryogenic fuel management scenario.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precise&lt;\/strong&gt;: Can gauge liquid levels within a &amp;frac14;-inch&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;\/strong&gt;: Requires just one fiber optic strand and one metallic wire, as opposed to conventional measurement systems, which require many more wires&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe&lt;\/strong&gt;: Is not susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI)&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robust&lt;\/strong&gt;: Can be used in corrosive or toxic liquids without damaging the fiber or contaminating the liquid&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerospace launch vehicles and satellites&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemical and refinery plants&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industrial tanks&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;\/ul&gt;",

        "notes":"<p>Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. <em>Aphis craccivora<\/em> and <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum<\/em> can harbor the symbiotic bacteria <em>Hamiltonella defensa<\/em> and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by <em>H. defensa<\/em> defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of <em>H. defensa<\/em> on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, <em>Aphelinus<\/em> species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with <em>H. defensa<\/em> \/APSE by two <em>Aphelinus<\/em> species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While <em>Aphelinus atriplicis<\/em> showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, <em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. <em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with <em>H. defensa<\/em> can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by <em>H. defensa<\/em> \/APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.<\/p>\n<h3>Insect sources and rearing conditions<\/h3>\n<p><em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> was collected in the Peoples Republic of China under a Memorandum of Understanding between their Ministry of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). <em>Aphelinus atriplicis<\/em> was collected by employees of the USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in the Republic of Georgia with the permission of that government. The parasitoids were imported into the USDA, ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit containment facility in Newark, Delaware, under permits from the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Permit Numbers P526P-08-02142 and P526P-09-01929). No specific permissions were required to collect <em>Aphis craccivora<\/em> or <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum<\/em> because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aphis craccivora<\/em> is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum<\/em> is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). <em>Aphis craccivora<\/em> in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and <em>Ac. pisum<\/em> were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, <em>Vicia faba<\/em> L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in <em>H. defensa<\/em> in <em>Ac. pisum<\/em> and APSE type 4 was found in <em>H. defensa<\/em> in <em>Ap. craccivora<\/em>. Aphid lines without <em>H. defensa<\/em> were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on <em>V. fava<\/em> plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of <em>H. defensa<\/em> from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from <em>Ap. craccivora<\/em> and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from <em>Ac. craccivora<\/em> were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of <em>H. defensa<\/em> and APSE prior to assays.<\/p>\n<p><em>Aphelinus atriplicis<\/em> was collected as mummified <em>Diuraphis noxia<\/em> on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; <em>A. glycinis<\/em> was collected as mummified <em>Aphis glycines<\/em> Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. <em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); <em>A. atriplicis<\/em> was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the <em>Aphelinus varipes<\/em> complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. <em>Aphelinus atriplicis<\/em> was reared on <em>D. noxia<\/em> on barley, <em>Hordeum vulgare<\/em> L. (Poaceae); <em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> was reared on <em>Aphis glycines<\/em> on soybean, <em>Glycine max<\/em> (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of <em>D. noxia<\/em> was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of <em>A. glycines<\/em> was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither <em>D. noxia<\/em> nor <em>A. glycines<\/em> are known to harbor <em>H. defensa<\/em>, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of <em>H. defensa<\/em> in our colonies of these species. Although <em>A. glycines<\/em> harbors another bacterium, <em>Arsenophonus<\/em>, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20\u00b0C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20\u00b0C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.<\/p>\n<h3>Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with <em>Hamiltonella defensa<\/em> versus uninfected aphids<\/h3>\n<p>To measure the effect of infection with <em>H. defensa<\/em> harboring APSE on parasitism of <em>Ap. craccivora<\/em> and <em>Ac. craccivora<\/em>, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of <em>Aphelinus atriplicis<\/em> or <em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with <em>H. defensa<\/em> or uninfected aphids on <em>V. faba<\/em> variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. <em>Aphelinus<\/em> females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.<\/p>\n<p>The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.<\/p>\n<p>Aphids parasitized by these <em>Aphelinus<\/em> species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50\u00b0C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.<\/p>\n<h3>Design structure<\/h3>\n<p>The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for <em>Aphelinus glycinis<\/em> on <em>Ap. craccivora<\/em> and <em>Aphelinus atriplicis<\/em> on <em>Ap. craccivora<\/em> and on <em>Ac. pisum<\/em> (24 each for <em>Hamiltonella<\/em>-infected versus uninfected aphids).<\/p>\n",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals, users also can find \"agricultural normals\", which are used in many industries, including but not limited to construction, architecture, pest control, etc. These supplemental \"agricultural normals\" include frost-freeze date probabilities, growing degree day normals, probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds, and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

        "notes":"SEISMIC_SHAKING_PREDICTED_RESPONSE_RP35_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the distribution and classification of National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil types. This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana. The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column. Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5): A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana. B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0. C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2. D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6. E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5. F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable. The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35: \"The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios. \"Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the results of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map.\"",

The aforementioned shellfish were collected in traditional harvest area in Resurrection Bay, AK and analyzed for contaminant body burdens and for occurrences of pathogens and diseases. A broad suite of contaminants were analyzed including 55 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) , 27 chlorinated pesticides including DDT and its break-down products, 37 Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), 16 major and trace elements (Ag, Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn and Zn), and tributyl-tin and its break-down products. The health of the subsistence shellfish were further characterized based on the presence an array of about 30 parasite taxa (e.g. bucephalus, chlamydia, ciliates, cestodes and nematodes) and occurrence of 11 diseases (e.g. MSX, tumors, neoplasm, edema and necrosis), which were quantified using prevalence and intensity computation. Results indicated that: - A great variation in metal body burdens among the different subsistence shellfish studied. Mercury was measured in all shellfish, but with the maximum value (0.2 ppm) found in blue mussels. Maximum tissue concentration for toxic metals such as chromium and Nickel were recorded in cockles. Maximum values for cadmium were found in mussels and softshell clams, while that of lead was found in the blue mussels. - Organic contaminants were detected in all subsistence shellfish although many of these compounds were banned more than three decades ago. - Metal and organic contaminant body burden were in general very low relatively to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for seafood safety. - Among the parasites assessed only large gill ciliates, small gill ciliates and gut rickettsia were detected in clam and blue mussels. - Among the bivalve diseases and tissue pathologies characterized in this study, digestive tubule atrophy was the most prevalent with 100% occurrence in cockles and mussels and about 96% in clams. Disease, such as ceroid bodies and histological condition such as diffuse and focal inflammations were also measured, but at relatively lower count than the digestive track atrophy. - In general, all infections and tissue pathology in the shellfish were minor and the conditions do not appear to be either a threat to the health of the shellfish or to humans that consume them. As a part of this study interspecies concentration factors (ICFs) that relate chemical concentrations in mussels to those in subsistence shellfish, were determined. The intent is to use ICFs as factor to evaluate contaminant concentrations in a wide range of Alaskan shellfish based upon measurements obtained for one species, thereby eliminating the need to monitor all species. Concentration values for many compounds were low or not detected, but where possible ICFs were calculated. This project provides invaluable baseline chemical body burden data on shellfish species that is geo-referenced and posted on the internet through the NOAA's National Status and Trends data portal.",

The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in\n                                 situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of\n                                 census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous\n                                 decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000\n                                 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic\n                                 status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical\n                                 changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition,\n                                 census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract\n                                 boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or\n                                 incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the\n                                 governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in\n                                 the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These\n                                 noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves\n                                 noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a\n                                 majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and\/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized \n                                 American Indian reservations and\/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts\n                                 that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military\n                                 installation, or a business\/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained\n                                 only water area, no land area.  \n            ",

NCEP-DOE AMIP-II reanalysis covers the \"20-year\" satellite period of 1979 to the present and uses an updated forecast model, updated data assimilation system, improved diagnostic outputs, and fixes for the known processing problems of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. Only minor differences are found in the primary analysis variables such as free atmospheric geopotential height and winds in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, while significant improvements upon NCEP-NCAR reanalysis are made in land surface parameters and land-ocean fluxes. This analysis can be used as a supplement to the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis especially where the original analysis has problems. The differences between the two analyses also provide a measure of uncertainty in current analyses. Atmospheric variables include temperature, humidity, wind speed, and geopotential height. Variables are available in several coordinate systems: pressure, Gaussian grid, spectral coefficients data, and as surface data. Temporal resolution is 6-hourly (4 time a day), and as daily and monthly averages.",

Results of desertification on the Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes. We hypothesize that these shifts in vegetation have changed resources temporally for many of the consumers. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags, but shrub systems do not, then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition, shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have hypothesized that consumer populations, diversity, and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands. Diversity and\/or densities are hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in order to provide data to test these hypotheses. Data for arthropods captured in pitfall traps on LTER III consumer plots at 2 month intervals. Data includes order, family, genus, species, and number.<\/p>\n",

Though effective, freshwater diversion can affect wildlife and habitat; therefore, prediversion and postdiversion data collections are necessary to identify effects. The Davis Pond freshwater diversion area is located between the Mississippi River and Bayou Lafourche and extends to Barataria Bay Basin, Louisiana. Results and interpretations from the prediversion biomonitoring done in 2001 - which included data on fish, eagles, and bivalves - are presented in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Scientific Investigations Report 2008-5067, \"Davis Pond Freshwater Prediversion Biomonitoring Study: Freshwater Fisheries and Eagles.\" The postdiversion data generated approximately 6 years later from the sampling of fish whole bodies are presented here in this USGS Data Series. An accompanying log of postdiversion study site photographs was also produced in USGS Data Series 605, \"Photographic Images Captured While Sampling for Bald Eagles near the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Structure in Barataria Bay, Louisiana (2009-10). This table presents the results of statistical analysis of variance of organic contaminants in fish sampled pre- and postdiversion of Davis Pond. Data collected consist of measurements of organic contaminants detected in largemouth bass, blue catfish and striped mullet samples collected in 2001 (prediversion) and 2007-2009 (6-8 years postdiversion). Total amounts of organic contaminants were compared using two-way and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Organic contaminants tested for include aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines (OCs), DDT, DDE, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A two-site analysis was performed to compare levels of contamination in fish drawn from the Mississippi River, and those collected from all marsh sites (Lake Cataouatche, Bayou Couba, and Lake Salvador).",

        "maintainer":"<Nobody>",
        "notes":"Introduction This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. As actual future population trends are unknown, the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather, these projections, calculated under a specific set of assumptions, indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births, deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report, and the details presented below, generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model, each component of population change \u2013 birth, death and net migration \u2013 is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort \u2013 component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation: P1 = P0 + B \u2013 D + NM Where: P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration \u2013 Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows: for every five-year projection period, the base population, disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex, is \u201csurvived\u201d to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next, net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1, 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1, 2010 was the base for July 1, 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties, the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign, Coles, DeKalb, Jackson, McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond, Brown, Crawford, Fayette, Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Lee, Logan, Montgomery, Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population, these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS), Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties, the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections, depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each projected TFR. Total births were then projected for each county by applying age-specific birth rates to the projected female population of reproductive ages (15 to 49 years). The total births were broken down by sex, using an assumed sex-ratio at birth. These births were survived five years applying assumed survival ratios to get the projected population for the age group 0-4. For the special counties, special populations by age and sex were taken out before computing age-specific birth rates. The resident birth data used to compute age-specific birth rates for 1989-1991, 1999-2001 and 2009-2011 came from ICHS. Births to females younger than 15 years of age were added to those of the 15-19 age group and births to women older than 49 years of age were added to the 45-49 age group. Net Migration Migration is the major component of population change in Illinois, Chicago and Illinois counties. The state is experiencing a significant loss of population through internal (domestic migration within the U.S.) net migration. Unlike data on births and deaths, migration data based on administrative records are not available on a regular basis. Most data on migration are collected through surveys or indirectly from administrative records (IRS individual tax returns). For this report, net migration trends have been reviewed using data from different sources and methods (such as residual method) from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Illinois Department of Public Health, individual exemptions data from the Internal Revenue Service, and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. On the basis of knowledge gained through this review and of levels of net migration from different sources, assumptions have been made that Illinois will have annual net migrants of -40, 000, -35,000 and -30,000 during 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. These figures have been distributed among the counties, using age and sex distribution of net migrants during 1995-2000. The 2000 population census was the last decennial census, which included the question \u201cWhere did you live five years ago?\u201d The age and sex distribution of the net migrants was derived, using answers to this question. The net migration for Chicago has been derived independently, using census survival method for 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 under the assumption that the annual net migration for Chicago will be -40,000, -30,000 and -25,000 for 2010-2015, 2015-2020 and 2020-2025, respectively. The age and sex distribution from the 2000-2010 net migration was used to distribute the net migrants for the projection periods. Conclusion These projections were prepared for use by the Certificate of Need (CON) Program; they are produced using evidence-based techniques, reasonable assumptions and the best available input data. However, as assumptions of future demographic trends may contain errors, the resulting projections are unlikely to be free of errors. In general, projections of small areas are less reliable than those for larger areas, and the farther in the future projections are made, the less reliable they may become. When possible, these projections should be regularly reviewed and updated, using more recent birth, death and migration data.",

Essentially, it compares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period. The revised CPI introduced by the BLS in 1998 includes indexes for two populations; urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW), and all urban consumers (CU). As a result of the revision, both the CW and the CU utilize updated expenditure weights based upon data tabulated from three years (1982, 1983, and 1984) of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and incorporate \r\na number of technical improvements, including an updated and revised item structure.",

It is the NGRP's responsibility to acquire, characterize, preserve, document, and distribute to scientists germplasm of all lifeforms important for food and agricultural production. <\/p>\n<p>The United States contains a broad array of livestock genetic resources that have been used by the livestock industry to improve production efficiency and increase food security. The National Animal Germplasm Program provides genetic security and increased understanding of these livestock populations for industry and research community use. The major components of the program  include information systems, genetic evaluation, and cryobiology, as well as the broad array of national and international collaborators that work with the NAGP in acquiring germplasm or tissue samples. These broader connections, like the NAGP Species Committees, are essential for capturing and assessing genetic variability. In addition this program interacts with international organizations in discussing policies concerning animal genetic diversity on a global scale and developing standardized methods for establishing and operating gene banks for livestock species.<\/p>\n<p>There are more than 500,000 accessions (distinct varieties of plants) in the GRIN database. These accessions represent more than 10,000 species of plants. See the Helps and Hints page if you are having trouble getting your results.

The DEMs are part of the tsunami forecast system SIFT (Short-term Inundation Forecasting for Tsunamis)\n                                        currently being developed by PMEL for the NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers, and are used in the MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) model developed by PMEL to simulate tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation. Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM compilation are obtained from various sources, including NGDC, the U.S. National Ocean Service (NOS), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal\n                                        Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. DEMs are referenced to the vertical tidal datum of Mean High Water (MHW) and horizontal datum of World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). Grid spacings for the DEMs range from 1\/3 arc-second (~10 meters) to 3 arc-seconds (~90 meters).",

The dataset presented here takes into account land-cover change due to four major land-use\/management activities: (1) cropland expansion and abandonment, (2) pastureland expansion and abandonment, (3) urbanization, and (4) secondary forest regrowth due to wood harvest. Due to uncertainties associated with estimating historical agricultural (crops and pastures) land use, the study uses three widely accepted global reconstruction of cropland and pastureland in combination with common wood harvest and urban land data set to provide three distinct estimates of historical land-cover change and underlying land-use conversions. Hence, these distinct historical reconstructions offer a wide range of plausible regional estimates of uncertainty and extent to which different ecosystem have undergone changes. The three estimates use a consistent methodology, and start with a common land-cover map during pre-industrial conditions (year 1765), taking different courses as determined by the land-use\/management datasets (cropland, pastureland, urbanization and wood harvest) to attain forest area distributions close to satellite estimates of forests for contemporary period.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian \/ Alaska Native \/ Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.",

This data contains the population of youth ages 13-26 in each county, the total population of each county, and the number and rate of index crimes reported, with domestic violence offenses and rates reported separately for every year between 2006 and 2015.  \n\nFor the purpose of this analysis the crime data was gathered from the Illinois State Police Annual report Crime in Illinois.  This publication is produced by the Illinois State Police every year using the UCR data that is submitted to them by individual jurisdictions throughout the state. The accuracy of this data presented is dependent on the local jurisdictions reporting their index crime and domestic violence offenses to ISP, so it can be included in the annual report. \n\nTherefore, if there is large decrease in number of index crimes reported in the dataset it is likely that one or more jurisdictions did not report data for that year to ISP.  If there is a large increase from year to year within a county it is likely that a jurisdiction within the county, who previously had not reported crime data, did report crime data for that year.  If there is no reported crime in a certain year that means no jurisdictions, or a small jurisdiction with no crime from that county reported data to the Illinois State Police. The annual Crime in Illinois reports can be found on the ISP website www.isp.state.il.us.  \n\nA direct link to that annual reports is: http:\/\/www.isp.state.il.us\/crime\/ucrhome.cfm#anlrpts.\n\nThe Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority did not record the data that is expressed in the dataset.  ICJIA simply used the ISP reports to compile that yearly crime data into one chart that could be provided to the Illinois Governor\u2019s Children\u2019s Cabinet. This data set has be critically examined to be accurate according to the annual Crime in Illinois Reports.  If there are issues with the data set provided please contact the Illinois State Police or the individual jurisdictions within a specific county.\n  \n**Index offenses do not include every crime event that occurs. Prior to 2014 there were 8 index crimes reported by the Illinois State Police in their annual reports, Criminal Homicide, Rape, Robbery, Aggravated Battery\/Aggravated Assault, Burglary, Theft, Motor Vehicle Theft, and Arson.  In 2014 there were two new offenses added to the list of index crimes these were Human Trafficking \u2013 Commercial Sex Acts and Human Trafficking \u2013 Involuntary Servitude.  These are the index crimes that are recorded in the chart provided.  \n\n**\u201cDomestic offenses are defined as offenses committed between family or household members. Family or household members include spouses; former spouses; parents; children; foster parents; foster children; legal guardians and their wards; stepchildren; other persons related by blood (aunt, uncle, cousin) or by present or previous marriage (in-laws); persons who share, or formerly shared, a common dwelling; persons who have, or allegedly have, a child in common; persons who share, or allegedly share, a blood relationship through a child; persons who have, or have had, a dating or engagement relationship; and persons with disabilities, their personal care assistants, or care givers outside the context of an employee of a public or private care facility. Every offense that occurs, when a domestic relationship exists between the victim and offender, must be reported (Illinois State Police).\u201d\n\n**\u201cOffenses reported are not limited to domestic battery and violations of orders of protection; offenses most commonly associated with domestic violence (Illinois State Police).\u201d\n\nThe crime rate was compiled using the total population, and the index crime.  The Index crime whether all crime or Domestic Violence crime was divided by the total population then multiplied by 10,000, hence crime rate per 10,000.  \n\nThe sources of data are the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe source of the description is the Illinois State Police and their Reporting guidelines and forms.",

        "notes":"<p>Organisms living in honey bees and honey bee colonies form large associative holobiont communities that are integral to bee biology.  High-throughput sequencing approaches to characterize these holobiont communities from honey bees in various states of health and disease are now commonplace, producing large amounts of nucleotide sequence data that must be accurately and consistently analyzed in order to produce reliable and comparable reports.  In addition, new species designations and revisions are actively being made from honey bee holobiont communities, complicating nomenclature in larger databases where taxonomic descriptions associated with archived sequences can quickly become outdated and misleading.<\/p>\n<p>To improve the accuracy and consistency of honey bee holobiont research, we have developed HoloBee: a curated database of publicly accessioned nucleotide sequences from the honey bee holobiont community.  Except in rare and noted exceptions made by curators, sequences used in HoloBee were obtained from, or in association with, <em>Apis mellifera<\/em> (Western honey bee) as well as other honey bee species where available (e.g. <em>Apis cerana<\/em>, <em>Apis dorsata<\/em>, <em>Apis laboriosa<\/em>, <em>Apis koschevnikovi<\/em>, <em>Apis florea<\/em>, <em>Apis andreniformis<\/em> and <em>Apis nigrocincta<\/em>).  Sources include:  within or on the surface of honey bees (adult, pupae, larvae, egg), corbicular pollen, bee bread, royal jelly, honey, comb, hive surfaces (e.g. bottom board debris, frames, landing platforms), and isolates of microbes, parasites and pathogens from honey bees.  HoloBee contains two non-overlapping sets of sequence data, HoloBee-Barcode and HoloBee-Mop, each of which have distinct intended uses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HoloBee-Barcode<\/strong> is a non-redundant database of taxonomically informative barcoding loci for all viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans and metazoans associated with honey bees (<em>Apis<\/em> spp.).  It was created from an exhaustive master sequence archive of all valid holobiont sequences.  Redundancy was removed from this master archive using a clustering algorithm that grouped sequences with \u2265 99% identity and retained the longest sequence from each cluster as the representative accession for that sequence type (\u201ccentroid\u201d).  These centroid sequences were concatenated into a fasta formatted file to create the HoloBee-Barcode database.  Associated taxonomy for each centroid, including Superkingdom through Species and Strain\/Isolate, was individually reviewed and corrected when necessary by a curator.  Cross reference tables (separated according to 5 major taxonomic groups) provide a user-friendly outline of information for each centroid accession within HoloBee-Barcode including taxonomy, gene\/product name, sequence length, the unaltered NCBI definition line, the number and identity of redundant sequences clustered within each centroid, and any additional information provided by the curator.  HoloBee-Barcode centroid counts are: Viruses = 86; Bacteria = 496; Fungi = 41; Protozoa = 4; Metazoa = 60.<\/p>\n<p>HoloBee-Barcode is intended to improve and standardize quantitative and qualitative metagenomic descriptions of holobiont communities associated with honey bees by providing a curated set of barcode sequences.  The goal of genetic barcoding is to associate a nucleotide sequence sample to a taxonomically valid species.  Genomic regions targeted for such barcoding purposes varied by taxonomic group.  The small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA, or 16S rRNA, is the most commonly used barcode for bacteria and is used in HB-Barcode.  These 16S rRNA sequences will support the analysis of data generated with the widely used approach of amplicon-based 16S rRNA deep sequencing to study microbiota communities.  Although barcode markers for fungi are less definitive than bacteria, HB-Barcode defaults to the ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), which typically includes ITS-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2.  For some clades that cannot be resolved by this region, other barcode markers were selected.  The majority of barcodes for metazoan taxa are the mitochondrial locus cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI).  Complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence for <em>Apis cerana<\/em> (Asian honey bee) and <em>Galleria mellonella<\/em> (Greater wax moth) are included as barcodes for these species.  We note that <em>A. cerana<\/em> mtDNA is included because it is considered a potentially invasive honey bee species and monitoring for its occurrence is in practice regionally, including in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.  Protozoan barcodes include cytochrome b oxidase (Cytb), SSU, or ITS while entire genomes are used for viral barcoding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HoloBee-Mop<\/strong> is a database comprised mostly of chromosomal, mitochondrial and plasmid genome assemblies in order to aggregate as much honey bee holobiont genomic sequence information as possible.  For a few organisms without genome assembly data, transcriptome data are included (e.g. <em>Aethina tumida<\/em>, small hive beetle).  Unlike HoloBee-Barcode, redundancy removal was not performed on the HoloBee-Mop database and thus this resource provides an archive of nucleotide sequence assemblies from honey bee holobionts.  However, since full viral genomes are used in HoloBee-Barcode, only redundant viral sequences occur in HoloBee-Mop.  All accessions within each of these assemblies were concatenated into a single fasta formatted file to create the HoloBee-Mop database.  The intended purpose of HoloBee-Mop is to improve honey bee genome and transcriptome assemblies by \u201cmopping-up\u201d as much viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan and non-honey bee metazoan sequence data as possible.  Therefore, sequence data remaining after processing reads through both HoloBee-Barcode and HoloBee-Mop that do not map to the honey bee genome may contain unique data from taxonomic variants or novel species.  Details for each sequence assembly within HoloBee-Mop are tabulated in cross reference tables according to each major taxonomic group.  HoloBee-Mop assembly counts are: Viruses = 2; Bacteria = 55; Fungi = 5; Protozoa = 1; Metazoa = 6.<\/p>\n<p>Follow the HoloBee database on Twitter at: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoloBee_db\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoloBee_db<\/a><\/p>\n",

The Integrated Report (IR) combines two water quality reports required under sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act.  Section 305(b) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to perform annual water quality assessments to determine the status of jurisdictional waters.  Section 303(d) requires states, territories and authorized tribes to identify waters assessed as not meeting water quality standards(see Code of Maryland Regulations 26.08.02).  Waters that do not meet standards may require a Total Maximum Daily Load to determine the maximum amount of an impairing substance or pollutant that a particular water body can assimilate and still meet water quality criteria.  Historically, the 303(d) List and the 305(b) report were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as separate documents but more recent guidance has called for combining these two reports into a single biennial publication.\r\n\r\nMore information is available at http:\/\/www.mde.state.md.us\/PROGRAMS\/WATER\/TMDL\/INTEGRATED303DREPORTS\/Pages\/Programs\/WaterPrograms\/TMDL\/Maryland%20303%20dlist\/index.aspx\r\n\r\nA searchable version of this data is available at http:\/\/www.mde.state.md.us\/programs\/Water\/TMDL\/Integrated303dReports\/Pages\/303d.aspx",

Bristol Bay boasts one of the largest commercial and subsistence salmon fisheries in the world. Significant mining activities have been proposed within the bay's watershed that could impact Bristol Bay chemistry and biology, but baseline data are lacking. Baseline data will be essential for monitoring pollution control effectiveness in the watershed. The datasets generated from this study will be incorporated into the NOAA's National Status and Trend (NS&T) Program database which has been developing a dynamic quantitative database on contaminants, toxicity and benthic infaunal species distribution assessed in the coastal U.S. since 1991. Therefore, the value of this project stems not only from the importance of the locale, but also from the fact that it will continue to expand the Alaskan data set in a national online database readily accessible to Alaskan coastal managers, scientific and local communities, and which will support the Alaska Fish Monitoring Program. This is a collaborative effort between the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), the Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).

MTI activities blend academics and physical activity into educational lessons that support New York State PE Learning Standards and are integrated with Common Core Learning Standards.\r\n\r\nThe MTI program is free and includes benefits and incentives for students, teachers, principals, and schools.\r\nMTI activities are inclusive and designed to enhance academic learning during classroom instruction.\r\nA growing body of research suggests that student success depends on a combination of academic skills, healthy lifestyle, and physical and mental fitness. Specifically, in NYC, the correlation between fitness levels and academic achievement has been shown:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/doh\/downloads\/pdf\/survey\/survey-2009fitnessgram.pdf\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star school\r\n\r\nSchools with a comprehensive PE program, led by a certified or designated PE teacher, have the opportunity to become an MTI All-Star school by training at least 85% of their eligible teachers in MTI.\r\n\r\nNew York State requires all elementary schools to provide at least 120 minutes of PE every week for all students. MTI All-Star schools can use MTI activities during classroom instructional time to supplement their existing PE program to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star schools receive MTI implementation guidance and Citywide recognition of MTI best practices\r\n\r\nAll NYC district public schools with classroom teachers serving grades K-5 are eligible to participate in the MTI program.\r\n\r\nFor the 2016-2017 school year, elementary schools can participate in MTI in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) MTI Train-the-Trainer\r\n\r\n- Certified or designated PE teachers from district public elementary schools can attend an MTI Train-the-Trainer (TTT) session where they will learn to become MTI trainers for their school.\r\n\r\n- TTT sessions are offered during school hours so PE teachers will need to be released to attend.\r\n\r\n2) MTI Event\r\n\r\n- K-5 classroom teachers (including cluster, PE, and special education) from district public schools can register for an open MTI workshop session offered citywide.\r\n\r\n- Participating teachers receive UFT negotiated training rate (for after-school hours) and a certificate of completion (can count towards the 175 hours of professional development; contingent on principal\u2019s approval).\"",

The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.<\/p>\n<p>Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.

It is located at the seaward edge of Kailua Bay, Windward Oahu. The buoy is a 0.9 m metallic floating sphere with a combination of a bungee and chain anchoring system. The long-term availability of this mooring is uncertain. The directional waverider measures the horizontal and vertical components of acceleration of the buoy, which rides up and down with the waves as it floats on the surface. The sampling rate is 1 Hz and the acquisition time is 20 minutes. From the accelerations of each acquisition time, spectra of energy by frequency and direction are derived. In addition, significant wave height and dominant wave period are calculated. The information is relayed to a shore data logging platform every 30 minutes. The Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) are the primary stewards of the real-time data while UH handles maintenance duties.",

The first provides all compiled results emphasizing the full spatial extent of the data, while the second is a subset that provides only data from a series of profile samples emphasizing the vertical distribution of microbial biomass concentrations.There is a companion file, also in .csv format, of the references for the surveyed publications. A reference_number relates the data to the respective publication.The concentrations of soil microbial biomass, in combination with other soil databases, were used to estimate the global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N in 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm soil profiles.

        "notes":"Reef fish populations are a conspicuous and essential component of USVI coral reef ecosystems. Yet despite their importance, striking population and community level changes have occurred in the recent past due to fishing pressure and habitat degradation. The monitoring methodologies described in this document are necessary for understanding how natural and anthropogenic stressors are changing reef fish populations and communities and will be critical for their sustainable management. A collaborative research effort between the NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment's Biogeography Branch (BB) and the National Park Service (NPS) has been used to inventory and assess reef fish populations in reef and reef-associated habitats in the northeast region of St. Croix from 2001-2011. The survey method previously used has been refined to enable broader region-wide coverage at the scale of the USVI yet maintains high precision at the Marine Protected Area (MPA) spatial level. Region-wide population metric estimates are required to effectively manage reef fisheries but are also imperative for spatial management and understanding ecosystem-level processes. For example, the ability to place protected fish resources in the context of the greater region not only allows for the evaluation of management actions but it also provides the ability to determine the ecological role of an MPA in the greater ecosystem. The monitoring method previously used by the Biogeography Branch and other partners in St. Croix and other regions within the USVI and Puerto Rico will be used to characterize and establish baseline data for future monitoring. St. Croix was chosen to serve as the first area to implement the protocol and to evaluate the logistics necessary to implement a long term monitoring program in the USVI as part of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP). Characterization and monitoring of fish communities requires a quantitative measure of the spatial distribution and variation of those communities. These measures will enable managers to make targeted management decisions (e.g. where to allow mooring or where to allow recreational activities such as snorkeling and SCUBA diving). Additionally, the spatial setting, both within and outside protected regions allows managers to assess the impact, if any, of a change in regulation such as the prohibition of fishing. It also enables analysis of any differential effect (i.e. the effect may be the same throughout the region or it may be more effective toward an edge or center of a management area). To quantify patterns of spatial distribution and make meaningful interpretations, we must first have knowledge of the underlying variables determining species distribution.  The basis for this work therefore, is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models.  The sampling domain includes all hardbottom habitats around St. Croix at depths less than 30m.   The benthic habitat map and a habitat classification scheme were used to create a sample frame constructed with 50 x 50 m grids. Grids were stratified based on three variables: Hardbottom habitat type, depth zone, and region\/management area.   Habitat within these grids was stratified into 5 habitat categories (scattered coral\/ rock, pavement, bedrock, patch reef and linear reef) each with two depth classifications (shallow (0-11.9 m) and deep (12- 30m)).  Further stratification was assigned based on management zones and region of the island.  There are three managed areas in St. Croix.  Two federal marine protected areas are managed by the Department of Interior's National Park Service: Buck Island Reef National Monument and Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Reserve.  The St. Croix East End Marine Park is a territorial marine protected area managed by the USVI Department of Planning and Natural Resources.  Other strata include specific regions of St. Croix: North, East, West, and South shores.  Overall there were 70 possible strata: 5 habitat types, 2 depth zones and 8 management areas\/regions. The monitoring objectives of this protocol are to determine status, trends, and variability in exploited reef fish species and communities within the USVI region and inside vs. outside different management zones, using measures such as relative abundance (density), spatial distribution, size structure and diversity. The survey design is optimized for nine economically and ecologically important species in the USVI: blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus). queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), coney (Cephalopholis fulva), red hind (Epinephelus guttatus), foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus), French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum), yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) and threespot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons). These species were chosen to include a broad range of life history traits as well as a variety of habitat utilization patterns. The sample design is optimized with the respect to these species, but because all fish species are recorded, monitoring efforts also obtain important information about many non-targeted species, the overall trophic structure, and form the scientific basis for effective management actions. As such, the sample allocation for this mission is based upon the existing community metrics and the above species specific distribution from the northeast region of St. Croix. It was determined that 250 samples among the various strata would be sufficient to characterize hard bottom habitats around the island and have comparable coefficient of variation (CV) to values observed in the northeast region of St. Croix.  The goal was to survey as many of the 250 sites as possible in a two week time period.  We organized a strong science field team and completed 286 fish and benthic surveys around the island.",

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",

Although ample literature exists on the climatological aspects of drought, little is known on whether existing drought indices can predict the damages and how different human communities respond and adapt to the hazard. This project examines (1) whether existing drought indices can predict the occurrence of drought events and their actual damages; (2) how the adaptive capacity (i.e., resilience) varies across space; and (3) what public outreach and engagement effort would be most effective for mitigation of risk and impacts. The study region includes all 503 counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. This data set was created to examine the first objective of the project. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI) data, available only at the climate-division level, were downscaled into county-level indices over the 1975-2010 period. The drought damage data, acquired from the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUSTM), were tabulated for the same time period. Statistical correlations were conducted between drought indices and drought damages to test whether these indices accurately represent the drought damage in the study region. This data set contains the two county-level drought indices and drought damage for the period 1975-2010, which should be useful to future related studies.",

        "notes":"This data represents all emergency medical services calls related to possible opioid abuse. \r\n\r\n__Locations represented are approximated and not the actual location of the incident. A computer generated randomized distance adjustment is applied to each incident location provided in the spreadsheet on the Open Data site to ensure data are anonymous. This approximated location data is also shown on the dashboard .__\r\n\r\n\r\n__Opioid Abuse Probable__\r\n\r\nA call may be coded as \u201copioid abuse probable\u201d for many reasons, such as\r\n\r\n* Are there are any medical symptoms indicative of opioid abuse?\r\n* Are there physical indicators on scene (i.e. drug paraphernalia, pill bottles, etc.)?\r\n* Are there witnesses or patient statements made that point to opioid abuse?\r\n* Is there any other evidence that opioid abuse is probable with the patient?\r\n\r\n\u201cOpioid abuse probable\u201d is determined by Tempe Fire Medical Rescue Department\u2019s Emergency medical technicians and paramedics on scene at the time of the incident. \r\n\r\n__Narcan\/Naloxone Given__\r\n\r\n\u201cNarcan\/Naloxone Given\u201d refers to whether the medication Narcan\/Naloxone was given to patients who exhibited signs or symptoms of a potential opioid overdose or to patients who fall within treatment protocols that require Narcan\/Naloxone to be given.  Narcan\/Naloxone are the same medication with Narcan being the trade name and Naloxone being the generic name for the medication.  Narcan is the reversal medication used by medical providers for opioid overdoses.\r\n\r\n__Groups__\r\n\r\n\u201cGroups\u201d are used to determine if there are specific populations that have an increase in opioid abuse. \r\n\r\n* The student population at ASU was being examined for other purposes to determine ASU's overall call volume impact in Tempe. Data collection with the university is consistent with Fire Departments who provide service to the other PAC 12 universities. Since this data set was already being evaluated, it was included in the opioid data collection as well.\r\n* The Veteran and Homeless Groups were established as demographic tabs to identify trends and determine needs in conjunction with the City of Tempe\u2019s Veterans and Homeless programs.  Since these data sets were being evaluated already, they were included in the opioid data collection as well.\r\n* The \u201cunknown\u201d group includes incidents where a patient is unable to answer or refuses to answer the demographic questions.  \r\n\r\n__Gender__\r\n\r\nPatient gender is documented as male or female when crews are able to obtain this information from the patient. There are some circumstances where this information is not readily determined and the patient is unable to communicate with our crews. In these circumstances, crews may document unknown\/unable to determine. \r\n\r\n__Data Set History__\r\n\r\nData sets were evolving in 2017 due to software upgrades and identifying new parameters to focus data collection on.  The 2018 data will be a more comprehensive set of data that includes all the fields identified throughout 2017.  Data sets may continue to evolve based on the needs of the community and healthcare trends. \r\n\r\nInformation about the data can be found at [Data Documentation](http:\/\/bit.ly\/2GftQtN)",

This dataset is representative for the period between 1980 to 2000s corresponding with the highest density of observations available in the WoSIS system and the covariates used as prediction factors for soil organic carbon across Latin America. SOC stocks (kg\/m2) were estimated for the SOC and bulk density point measurements and a spatially explicit measure of the SOC estimation error was also calculated. A modeling ensemble, using a linear combination of five statistical methods (regression Kriging, random forest, kernel weighted nearest neighbors, partial least squared regression and support vector machines) was applied to the SOC stock data at (1) country-specific and (2) regional scales to develop gridded SOC estimates (kg\/m2) for all of Latin America. Uncertainty estimates are provided for the two model predictions based on independent model residuals and their full conditional response to the SOC prediction factors.",

It has focused on conservation of ecosystem function through reducing soil erosion and spread of invasive plants. Effectiveness of mitigation treatments has been debated recently. We searched for literature on postfire seeding of rangelands worldwide. Literature databases searched included SCOPUS, Dissertation Abstracts, Forest Science, Tree search, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and science.gov. Search terms within publications included fire or wildfire in combination with seeding, rehabilitation, restoration, revegetation, stabilization, chaining, disking, drilling, invasives, weeds, cheatgrass, medusahead, sagebrush, rangeland, or grassland. The initial pool of potentially relevant articles numbered 1,519. Abstracts of all papers were reviewed. This pool included many papers not directly relevant to our review, including different ecosystems and different issues associated with wildfire (e.g. air pollution or property damage). On the basis of titles and abstracts, 126 potentially relevant papers were reviewed by at least two investigators. Upon further evaluation, some papers either did not pertain to our focal ecosystems or did not address aspects of soil erosion or invasive species. Effectiveness of postfire seedings was examined in 8 erosion and 19 invasive species cases. This data set provides these citations and the evaluations of the two observers.",

        "notes":"The NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was initially completed for the 31-year period from 1979 to 2009, in January 2010. The CFSR was designed and executed as a global, high resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this 31-year period. The CFSR has also been extended as an operational, real time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include: (1) coupling of atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6 hour guess field; (2) an interactive sea-ice model; and (3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is approximately 38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25 deg at the equator, extending to a global 0.5 deg beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737m. The global land surface model has four4 soil levels and the global sea ice model has 3 layers. The CFSR atmospheric model has observed variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) over the 1979-2009 period, together with changes in aerosols and other trace gases and solar variations. Most available in-situ and satellite observation data were included in the CFSR. Satellite-based radiance observations were bias corrected with spin-up runs at full resolution, taking into account variable CO2 concentrations. This procedure enabled smooth transitions of the observation record due to evolutionary changes in satellite observing systems. The CFSR atmospheric, oceanic and land surface output products are available at an hourly time resolution and at a 0.5 deg x 0.5 deg latitude and longitude resolution. In total, there are 10 data products available from the National Climatic Data Center that make up the CFS Reanalysis collection: MON - Monthly Means; TIME - Parameter Timeseries; PGB - 3-D Pressure Level Data; FLX - Surface and Radiative Fluxes; OCN - 3-D Ocean Data; IPV - 3-D Isentropic Level Data; DIAB - 3-D Diabatic Heating Data; GRBLOW - Low-Resolution Data; HIC - High-Res Initial Conditions; LIC - Low-Res Initial Conditions. All data are in GRIB-2 format, except for the initial condition data which are in native binary formats. Total CFSR data volume is approximately 200 TB.",

The orbital period is 101 minutes and inclination is 99 degrees. The space weather sensors collect insitu observations from the near-Earth space environment to measure ionospheric plasma fluxes, densities, temperatures and velocities. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) presently receives the space weather data stream from the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) maintain a publicly accessible archive and derived extensions of these data records. The DMSP SSJ\/4\/5 data provide a complete energy spectrum of the low energy particles that cause the aurora and other high altitude phenomena. The Special Sensor Magnetometer (SSM) measures geomagnetic fluctuations associated with geophysical phenomena (i.e., ionospheric currents flowing at high latitudes). The Special Sensor Ion Electron Scintillation (SSIES) instrument observes the ambient plasma by measuring 1) electron density and temperature; 2) ion density, temperature and drift velocity; and 3) scintillation at the DMSP orbital altitude.",

        "notes":"High-resolution mass spectrometry is advantageous for monitoring physiological impacts and contaminant biotransformation products in fish exposed to complex wastewater effluent.  We evaluated this technique using skin mucus from male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to control water or treated wastewater effluent at 5%, 20%, and 100% levels for 21 d, using an onsite, flow-through system providing real-time exposure.  Both sex-specific and non-sex-specific responses were observed in the mucus metabolome, the latter suggesting the induction of general compensatory pathways for xenobiotic exposures.  Altogether, 85 statistically significant treatment-dependent metabolite changes were observed and 30 of those annotated with probable structures.  The mummichog software package was used to elucidate impacted biochemical pathways and enhance metabolite annotation.  Partial least squares regression models revealed relationships between the mucus metabolomes and upregulated hepatic mRNA transcripts reported previously for these same fish.  These regression models suggest that mucus metabolomic changes reflected, in part, processes by which the fish biotransformed xenobiotics in the effluent.  Further, we detected a phase II transformation product of bisphenol A in the skin mucus of male fish.  Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of mucus as a minimally invasive matrix for simultaneously assessing exposures and effects of real-world mixtures of contaminants. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMosley, J., D.

The Area of Interest (AOI) is 632,000 acres and is larger than the actual\n                burn acreage of approximately 150,000 acres that lies within the AOI. Aerial imagery\n                was collected with a frame - based Z\/I Digital Mapping Camera at an average of\n                elevation of 4,500 feet above ground; generating an average ground sample distance\n                (gsd) of 0.45 feet. This aerial imagery will be used to create natural color and\n                false color infrared digital orthophotos of the AOI at a re-sampled gsd of .3\n                meters.

While many wildfires cause little damage to the\n                land and pose few threats to fish, wildlife and people downstream, the fires of 2011\n                has in this case created situations that require special efforts to prevent further\n                problems after the fire. Loss of vegetation exposes soil to erosion; runoff may\n                increase and cause flooding, sediments may move downstream and damage houses or fill\n                reservoirs, and put endangered species and community water supplies at risk. The\n                imagery will support the Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)\n                program that addresses these situations with the goal of protecting life, property,\n                water quality, and deteriorated ecosystems from further damage after the fire is\n                out.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.  For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian \/ Alaska Native \/ Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.  \n",

It is a critical element in the Census Bureau's reengineered decennial census program, incorporating the detailed socioeconomic and housing questions that were previously asked on the decennial census long form into the ACS questionnaire. The ACS now collects and produces this detailed population and housing information every year instead of every ten years. Data are collected on an on-going basis throughout the year and are released each year for large geographic areas, those with 65,000 persons or more. However, sample sizes are not large enough for annual releases that cover smaller areas, those with less than 65,000 persons. Data that are suitable for areas with 20,000 to 65,000 persons are accumulated over three years and termed a three-year period estimate, the first of which was for the 2005-2007 period. Data that are suitable for areas with less than 20,000 persons are accumulated over five years and termed a five-year period estimate, the first of which was for the 2005-2009 period. The data in this series of RGIS Clearinghouse tables are for all New Mexico counties and are based on the 2005-2009 ACS Five-Year Period Estimates collected between January 2005 and December 2009. These data tables are a summary of all major economic topics published through the ACS, providing statistics on employment status, commuting to work, occupation, industry, class of worker, household income distributions, household income by type, family income distributions, nonfamily household income, incomes of individuals, and family and person poverty rates. Percentages are shown along with numeric estimates for most data items. Because the data are based on a sample the Census Bureau also provides information about the magnitude of sampling error. Consequently, the estimated margin of error (MOE) is shown next to each data item. Each economic topic is covered in a separate file in both Excel and CSV formats. These files, along with file-specific descriptions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file.",

        "notes":"This dataset replaces the previous Time Bias Corrected Divisional Temperature-Precipitation Drought Index. The new divisional data set (nCLIMDIV) is based on the Global Historical Climatological Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and makes use of several improvements to the previous data set. For the input data, improvements include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews and temperature bias adjustments. Perhaps the most extensive improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation. This 5km grid based calculation nCLIMGRID helps to address topographic and network variability. This data set is primarily used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to issue State of the Climate Reports on a monthly basis. These reports summarize recent temperature and precipitation conditions and long-term trends at a variety of spatial scales, the smallest being the climate division level. Data at the climate division level are aggregated to compute statewide, regional and national snapshots of climate conditions. For CONUS, the period of record is from 1895-present. Derived quantities such as Standardized precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, and ZNDX) and degree days are also available for the CONUS sites. \n\nIn March 2015, data for thirteen Alaskan climate divisions were added to the nCLIMDIV data set. Data for the new Alaskan climate divisions begin in 1925 through the present and are included in all nCLIMDIV monthly updates. Alaskan climate data include the following elements for divisional and statewide coverage: average temperature, maximum temperature (highs), minimum temperature (lows), and precipitation. The Alaska nCLIMDIV data were created and updated using similar methodology as that for the CONUS, but with a different approach to establishing the underlying climatology. The Alaska data are built upon the 1971-2000 PRISM averages whereas the CONUS values utilize a base climatology derived from the nCLIMGRID data set.\n\nAs of November 2018, nClimDiv includes county data and additional inventory files.",

The algorithms are evaluated using data from the Electrical Power System (EPS), which simulates the functions of a typical aerospace vehicle power system. The EPS allows for the controlled insertion of faults in repeatable failure scenarios to test if diagnostic algorithms can detect and isolate these faults.\r\n\r\n**How Data Was Acquired**\r\n\r\nThis dataset was generated from the EPS in the ADAPT lab. Each data file corresponds to one experimental run of the testbed. During an experiment, a data acquisition system commands the testbed into different configurations and records data from sensors that measure system variables such as voltages, currents, temperatures and switch positions. Faults were injected in some of the experimental runs.\r\n\r\n**Sample Rates and Parameter Descriptions**\r\n\r\nData was sampled at a rate of 2 Hz and saved into a tab delimited plain text file. There are a total of 128 sensors and typical experimental runs last for approximately five minutes. The text files have also been converted into a MATLAB environment file containing equivalent data that may be imported for viewing or computation.\r\n\r\n**Faults and Anomalies**\r\n\r\nFaults were injected into the EPS using physical or software means. Physical faults include disconnecting sources, sinks or circuit breakers. For software faults, user commands are passed through an Antagonist function before being received by the EPS, and sensor data is filtered through the same function before being seen by the user. The Antagonist function was able to block user commands, send spurious commands and alter sensor data.\r\n\r\n**External Links**\r\n\r\nAdditional data from the ADAPT EPS testbed can be found at the DXC competition page - [https:\/\/dashlink.arc.nasa.gov\/topic\/diagnostic-challenge-competition\/](https:\/\/dashlink.arc.nasa.gov\/topic\/diagnostic-challenge-competition\/)\r\n\r\n**Other Notes**\r\n\r\nThe HTML diagrams can be viewed in any brower, but its active content is best run on Internet Explorer.",

Vegetation types were classified with refuge-derived classes and then linked to the National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) at the Formation level, and whenever possible, the Alliance level. The photos were interpreted using a minimum mapping unit of 2-acres (Polygons may be smaller than two acres when different modifiers were used within the same class or when mapping a significant feature) and a 25% minimum vegetation cover. The photos were interpreted to delineate land cover\/land use, percent vegetation cover, and tree height.

Archived and distributed through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC), the Daymet dataset for Goodwin Creek provides gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, including daily continuous surfaces of minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation occurrence and amount, humidity, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and day length. The Goodwin Creek site is located in the Bluff Hills, just east of the Mississippi River valley. In addition to being a core AmeriFlux site, Goodwin Creek is affiliated with a multitude of other projects including Surface Radiation (SURFRAD), Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), and is one of twelve USDA Conservation Reserve Program watersheds. Natural disturbances are of minimal influence to the site. The immediate region is primarily used for grazing while infrequent logging activities occur in nearby forests. The grass surrounding the base of the tower is mowed periodically to maintain a height consistent with the regional grasslands.<br \/>\n               Daymet is supported by funding from NASA through the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Program.

The measurements are homogenized by applying corrections that are calculated from data taken during time periods of instrument overlap. The primary SWOOSH data product consists of monthly-mean zonal-mean values on a pressure grid. In addition to the primary (zonal-mean) grid, SWOOSH data are also available on 3D (longitude\/latitude\/pressure), equivalent latitude, and isentropic grids. The gridded data include the mean, standard deviation, number of observations, and mean uncertainty from each instrument. Also included is a merged (multi-instrument) product based on a weighted mean of the available measurements.
