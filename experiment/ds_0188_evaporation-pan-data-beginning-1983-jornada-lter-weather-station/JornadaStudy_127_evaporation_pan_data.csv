File header updated by Ken Ramsey on 02/11/2013.

Data entered & verified in KeyesPunch dataentry software beginning with date 5/8/12. 
Data appended to this file from KeyesPunch data output file

Variable description:
interval_days = number of days between readings (date_read minus begin_period)
date_start = beginning date on which evaporation calculation is based
date_read = date of measurement
time = military time of measurement
curT = current water temperature (F)
minT = minimum water temperature since last reading (F)
maxT = maximum water temperature since last reading (F)
i_water = initial water level (inches)
f_water = final water level after evaporation (inches)
rain = rainfall since last measurement (inches)
init = initials of field reader
evap = evaporation since last good measurement (begin_period to date_read) (inches)
qflag = quality flag (C=good data. Comment present; G=good data; E=esimated water level; H=water level too high to measure; I=ice in pan; L=water level too low to measure; Q=questionable water level; R=missing rain data; T=missing min or max temperature; W=missing water level
comment = comment
